# Custom Hooks Standards

## Hook Naming and Structure
- Hook names must start with `use` prefix
- Use descriptive names that indicate the hook's purpose
- Place hooks in `src/hooks/` directory
- Export both the hook and its types

## Hook Guidelines
- Return objects with named properties for multiple values (not arrays)
- Include proper TypeScript typing for parameters and return values
- Handle loading states and errors consistently
- Use proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Document complex hooks with JSDoc comments
