# Testing Standards

## Testing Framework
- Use Vitest as the primary testing framework
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

## Test Structure
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks

## Component Testing
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Query elements by role, label, or text (accessibility-first)
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Referenced Templates
@component-test-template.tsx
@hook-test-template.ts
